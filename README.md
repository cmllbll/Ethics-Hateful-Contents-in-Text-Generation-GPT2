9-month project supervised by INRIA and tackling the issue of the generation of hate speech by automatic text generation models such as GPT-2. The project includes the implementation of n-grams to generate text according to different ways of decoding (greedy decoding, sampling) and the handling of the GPT-2 software, as well as sentiment analyzes on the topics generated by the models.
